## What is this?

`Editable` is an extensible rich text editor framework that focuses on stability, controllability, and performance. To achieve this, we did not use the native editable attribute [~~contenteditable~~](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable), but instead used a custom renderer that allows us to better control the editor's behavior. From now on, you no longer have to worry about cross-platform and browser compatibility issues (such as `Selection`, `Input`), just focus on your business logic.
